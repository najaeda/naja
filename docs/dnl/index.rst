=========

.. image:: ../images/Naja-DNL.png

DNL is set to achieve multi-threaded browsing capabilities, incorporating associated functors and user
callbacks. Following industry standards, it will support rapid flat traversal and will be designed as an
index-based netlist representation. This approach aims to minimize memory footprint and facilitate the
native implementation of multithreading algorithms.
