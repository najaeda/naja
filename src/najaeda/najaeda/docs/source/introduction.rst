Introduction
============

``najaeda`` is an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Python package for
loading, elaborating, navigating, analyzing, and editing hardware designs from
RTL SystemVerilog through structural netlists.  It gives Python users access
to Naja's SNL database: designs, libraries, instances, terms, nets,
attributes, hierarchical paths, occurrences, and equipotentials.

Typical use cases include:

* loading Verilog, elaborated SystemVerilog, Liberty, primitive libraries, and
  Naja interchange files;
* exploring hierarchy, ports, nets, instance terminals, and flat connectivity;
* writing netlist analysis passes such as fanout, logic-level, and design
  inventory reports;
* applying ECO-style edits such as renaming, reconnecting, deleting, and
  uniquifying designs as needed;
* exporting data to text, JSON, pandas, DOT, Verilog, or Naja interchange for
  downstream tooling.

The recommended API entry point is :mod:`najaeda.netlist`.  It keeps object
identity stable across hierarchy, converts native C++ objects into Python
wrappers, and performs automatic uniquification before edits that would
otherwise affect shared models.

An expert raw API is also available as :mod:`najaeda.naja`.  It exposes the
compiled ``naja`` extension module and mirrors the underlying SNL C++ model
more closely.  See :doc:`raw_api` when you need this lower level.
