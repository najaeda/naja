Naja EDA Python Package
=======================

Naja EDA is a Python package that provides data structures and APIs for developing post-synthesis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) algorithms.

Naja EDA provides a powerful yet simple framework designed to help software
and hardware developers efficiently navigate and manipulate electronic
design automation (EDA) workflows.

With Naja EDA, you can:

* Explore Netlists with Ease:

  * Navigate netlist hierarchy and connectivity effortlessly.
  * Browse at multiple levels of detail:

    * Bit-level or bus-level granularity.
    * Instance-by-instance exploration or flattened views at the primitives level.
    * Localized per-instance connections or comprehensive equipotential views.

* Perform ECO (Engineering Change Order) Transformations:

  * Seamlessly apply and manage changes to your designs.

* Prototype EDA Ideas Quickly:

  * Use an intuitive API to experiment with new EDA concepts and workflows.

* Develop Custom EDA Tools:

  * Build fast, tailored tools for solving specific challenges without relying on costly, proprietary EDA software.

Naja EDA empowers developers to innovate, adapt, and accelerate their EDA
processes with minimal overhead.
