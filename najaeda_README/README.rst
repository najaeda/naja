Naja EDA Python Package
=======================

Naja EDA is a Python package that provides data structures and APIs for developing post-synthesis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) algorithms.
It serves as the Python counterpart to the `Naja C++ project <https://github.com/najaeda/naja>`_.

Installation
------------

Install Naja EDA using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install najaeda

Examples
--------

Load a design from a liberty file and a Verilog file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following snippet shows how to load primitive cells from a liberty file and
a netlist from a Verilog file.
.. snippet:: load_design_liberty

Load a design with pre-existing libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In FPGA design environments, Liberty files are often unavailable.
To address this, the following example demonstrates how to load primitives
without relying on Liberty files.

najaeda comes with pre-configured libraries to simplify this process.
Currently, it includes support for partial Xilinx primitives, but this can be
easily extended in the future. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need help.
.. snippet:: load_xilinx_design

Print all the instances in the netlist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next example shows how to browse all the netlist and print all its content recursively.
.. snippet:: print_design_recursive

Similar to the previous example, but utilizing an instance visitor.
This approach allows you to perform operations on each instance while
also defining conditions for stopping or continuing exploration.
.. snippet:: print_design_visitor
