# SystemVerilog External Regress

This regress checks out pinned external RTL repositories, loads them into Naja,
and runs structural, Verilog generation, lint, or simulation checks.

## Layout

```text

├── sv_regress.py       # stable runner entry point

```

Run the focused tests with `python3 -m pytest regress/sv/tests/`.
The CLI and manifest paths are unchanged; stage names such as `helloworld_sim`
remain unchanged too.

## Prerequisites

- Build Naja so `build/test/najaeda` exists.
- Install Python dependencies, including `PyYAML`.
- Install `fusesoc` for the Ibex setup flow.
- Install Docker for the default lint and GitHub smoke-simulation runs.
- Install local `verilator` when using `--lint-runner local` or `helloworld_sim`.
- Install a RISC-V firmware toolchain for `helloworld_sim`. The scripts prefer the
  `riscv32-unknown-elf-` prefix and also accept `riscv-none-elf-` and
  `riscv64-unknown-elf-`. `RISCV` is inferred from `PATH` when unset for
  CV32E40P. CV32E40P's upstream testbench links its firmware against newlib; the
  GitHub workflow installs xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC for that reason.

GitHub CI installs the Python dependencies and uses Dockerized Verilator. The
`External SV Regress` workflow runs lint for the small external designs and
load/dump checks for the large BlackParrot and CVA6 designs, plus Borg's
load/dump, lint, and pin-level cocotb regression. The `External SV
Simulation` workflow runs the checked-in Ibex and CV32E40P smoke simulations
plus the Ibex helloworld simulation, SecureIbex diagnostics, the CV32E40P
helloworld simulation, and an upstream CV32E40P interrupt simulation.

## List Cases

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py list
```

## Borg ASIC Semantic Round-Trip

The `borg` case pins gonsolo/Borg to
`fe915b3763768c7f49be18cc541ad6c96e9de5d8` and targets
`tt_um_gonsolo_borg`. The flow is Chisel-emitted ASIC SystemVerilog → Naja
load/elaboration → structural Verilog dump → upstream pin-level cocotb tests.
No generated Borg RTL is vendored.

Prerequisites in addition to a built Naja/PyYAML environment:

- Mill **1.1.2** (`BORG_MILL` may name an explicit executable). Its launcher
  resolves its versioned JVM/Scala dependencies; the pinned Borg build uses
  Scala 2.13.18 and Chisel 7.15.0, including Chisel's versioned firtool resolver.
  The first run needs network access to Maven Central and the JVM provider.
- A Python environment with `systemrdl-compiler==1.32.2`,
  `peakrdl-cheader==1.1.0`, and Jinja2. Set `BORG_PYTHON` to its Python executable
  if it differs from the Naja runner's interpreter.
- Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`, `vvp`), `cocotb-config` from **cocotb 2.0.1**,
  `riscv-model==0.6.6`, and NumPy. Python 3.13 is supported by this cocotb
  release; Python 3.14 is not. `cocotb-config` must belong to the simulation
  Python environment. The adapter asks it for the Python binary and libpython,
  keeping that ABI separate from Naja's compiled Python bindings.

For example, create a separate environment for RDL/cocotb if Naja is built
against Python 3.14:

```sh
python3.13 -m venv /tmp/naja-borg-tools
/tmp/naja-borg-tools/bin/pip install \
  -r regress/sv/cases/borg/requirements.txt
export BORG_PYTHON=/tmp/naja-borg-tools/bin/python
export PATH="$PATH:/tmp/naja-borg-tools/bin"
```

If Mill is not installed, download the exact version's launcher to a file,
inspect it, then make it executable (no unpinned download or `curl | sh`):

```sh
curl -L --fail \
  https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/lihaoyi/mill-dist/1.1.2/mill-dist-1.1.2-mill.sh \
  -o /tmp/naja-borg-mill-1.1.2
chmod +x /tmp/naja-borg-mill-1.1.2
export BORG_MILL=/tmp/naja-borg-mill-1.1.2
```

This is Mill's [documented launcher installation flow](https://mill-build.org/mill/cli/installation-ide.html),
with the version fixed for this regression. The generator verifies the actual
Mill version and rejects a mismatch. Nix, PDK libraries, a firmware compiler,
and GNU sed are not required.

Run:

```sh
python3 -m pytest regress/sv/tests/test_sv_regress.py
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py list
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case borg --stage load_dump
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case borg --stage lint --lint-runner local
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case borg --stage borg_cocotb_sim --require-firmware-sim-tools
```

Keep `python3` on PATH in Naja's built Python environment. Only `BORG_PYTHON`
and `cocotb-config` need to point to the separate tools environment. As with
other configured simulation stages, missing optional simulation executables
skip unless `--require-firmware-sim-tools` is supplied. **RTL generation is
required and never silently skips**; missing Mill/RDL/firtool dependencies fail
even without that option.

`cases/borg/borg_generate.py` builds in `artifacts/rtl-work`, leaving the pinned checkout
unmodified. Only the pinned `PeakRDL-chisel` submodule is initialized (not Mesa,
Vulkan-Tools, or tapeout tools). The adapter invokes upstream RDL validation
and generation, then `CLOCK_MHZ=4 mill --no-server -j 1 asic.tt.runMain
asic.tt.TTMain` and upstream `init_bram_zero.py`. This preserves the semantics
of `make generate_verilog`, including its zero-initialized cache memory and
translate-on cleanup, without the Nix-specific Python shim or GNU sed.
Debug-trace environment switches are disabled for reproducibility.

Source selection reads **`asic_files.txt`**, resolving its paths relative to
upstream `src/`. TTMain forms that union from each firtool `filelist.f`; the
last `filelist.f` alone is insufficient. Both elaborations retain
`BorgConfig.Asic` and the same 4 MHz clock, preventing configuration-dependent
module overwrites. No broad RTL glob is used to reconstruct the list. SIM and
memory-initializer defines are enabled at Naja loading.

`cases/borg/borg_cocotb_sim.py` compiles exactly:

1. `artifacts/borg_naja.v`;
2. Naja's `test/nl/formats/systemverilog/benchmarks/najaeda_primitives.v`;
3. upstream `test/soc/tb.v`.

It imports the upstream Python tests/helpers and the freshly RDL-generated
`borg_mmio.py`, and reuses upstream test vectors. It runs exactly the core
pin-level smoke test `test.test_start` and peripheral ADD/MUL/FMA math test
`user_peripherals.borg.test.test_borg_shader_math_batch`, in separate simulator
processes. Firmware boot, Scala/Chisel unit tests, PDK simulation, FPGA/GDS,
Arcilator, and the framebuffer harness are not included. Chisel
`EphemeralSimulator` tests elaborate typed Chisel modules; they cannot replace
their DUT with this external Verilog netlist.

All generated design/build/simulation products are under
`build/sv-regress/borg/artifacts/`:

- `borg.flist`, `borg-source-selection.json`, and `rtl-work/.../asic_files.txt`:
  audit the exact ASIC sources and configuration;
- `borg-*-command.json`: exact RDL/Mill/post-step commands and working dirs;
- `borg_naja.v`, `design-stats.json`, `diagnostics.log`, and `summary.json`;
- `borg-cocotb-sim-build-command.json`: actual three-source Icarus command;
- `borg-cocotb-sim-{core,math}-run-command.json`: exact vvp commands and
  simulation environment;
- `borg-cocotb-sim/{core,math}-results.xml` and
  `borg-cocotb-sim-results.json`: explicit selected-test results;
- stable `logs/borg-cocotb-{build,core,math}.log` and combined
  `logs/borg-cocotb-sim.log`.

The pass indication is **`BORG_COCOTB_SIM_PASS`**, emitted only after fresh XML
reports exactly the expected passing test in both runs. Simulator exit alone,
missing/empty XML, selected-test skips, failures, errors, and stale results
cannot pass. Cocotb's explicitly filtered-out tests may appear as skipped XML
entries; these do not count as executed tests. The artifact-local `precision.f`
sets Icarus's [default timescale](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/command_files.html)
to 1ns/1ps for the structural dump and primitives, so upstream helpers' 2 ps
delays can be represented without modifying the 1ns/100ps upstream testbench.
Waveform dumping is disabled with vvp's `-none` argument to bound artifact size.

This is a **Naja structural netlist**, with portable behavioral models of
Naja's inferred operators, flops, and memories—not a technology-mapped PDK
gate-level netlist. The adapter never sets `GATES=yes`/`GL_TEST`, invokes the
upstream simulation Makefile, or compiles original Chisel-emitted RTL alongside
the dump. PDK cell models and power-pin glue are deliberately excluded.

Local macOS verification passed all three stages with 37 selected ASIC input
sources and no Naja unsupported diagnostics. Cold Scala/Chisel generation took
about 69 seconds; warm generation about 9 seconds, Naja load/dump about 13
seconds, local lint 21–27 seconds (about 2 GB allocated), and the complete
cocotb adapter about 110 seconds (including compile/startup). Both tests passed:
core smoke about 39 seconds and peripheral math about 47 seconds.

The central `External SV Regress` workflow (`.github/workflows/sv-regress.yml`)
runs all three Borg stages on pull requests and pushes to `main`, and supports
manual dispatch. It installs Icarus, the pinned Mill 1.1.2 launcher, and
`cases/borg/requirements.txt` in a separate Python 3.13 environment. Only Mill
and `cocotb-config` are added to PATH, preserving the runner's Python 3.12
interpreter and Naja bindings. The job uses `--require-firmware-sim-tools`, so
missing simulation tools fail rather than skip. Borg's logs and test results
are included in the workflow's always-uploaded `sv-regress-artifacts` artifact.

For a second tier, BorgSimTop plus the existing Verilator `cts-uart` replay and
`compare_ppm.py` golden-image comparison is a practical candidate. At this pin,
`BorgSimMain` emits the four-lane `BorgConfig.Simt` design into a separate
directory and collects `sim_files.txt`; it must not share the ASIC build's
module files. The C++ wrapper loads/reads SDRAM through public `dbg_*` top-level
ports, rather than relying on internal signal names. That tier would need a
Naja-only Verilator source adapter, a firmware toolchain/build, support for the
simulation SDRAM model, and a runtime/memory budget for up to 100 million
cycles. Upstream's runner compares the captured render with the pinned golden
using `--max-diff 1 --max-fail-pixels 2`. It is deliberately not implemented here.

## Default Run

The default `run` stages are `lint` and `github_sim`.

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case ibex --case cv32e40p
```

This matches the lightweight CI intent: Verilator lint plus checked-in smoke
simulation testbenches.

## Large Design Load/Dump

BlackParrot and CVA6 are too large for GitHub-hosted simulation jobs, so CI
only checks that Naja can load, elaborate, and dump them back to Verilog:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case black_parrot \
  --case cva6 \
  --stage load_dump
```

The generated Verilog and `load-dump.log` are written under each case artifact
directory.

## Z-Core Full Dump Verification

The Z-Core case follows the pinned upstream `tb/Makefile` source-list and
simulation model. It elaborates `z_core_top`, dumps the complete reachable
design, lints that complete dump, and runs a top-level reset/execution smoke
simulation against the same dump:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case zcore \
  --stage load_dump \
  --stage lint \
  --stage github_sim
```

The simulation expects `ZCORE_TOP_SMOKE_PASS` after reset and 200 full-SoC
clock cycles, and rejects unknown UART or GPIO outputs.

## Logic-Cone Signatures

The `logic_cones` stage builds manifest-selected cones while the pinned external
design is loaded, before dumping Verilog. It checks stable structural counts:
nodes, edges, leaves, roots, registers, ports, blackboxes, and internal nodes.

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case cva6 \
  --stage logic_cones
```

Probe roots and expected counts live under `logic_cones` in `cases.yml`. Actual
results are always written to
`build/sv-regress/<case>/artifacts/logic-cones.json`, including on a signature
mismatch, so an intentional update can be reviewed rather than guessed.

## Ibex Smoke Simulation

Run lint and the Ibex smoke simulation:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case ibex --stage lint --stage github_sim
```

Run only the Ibex smoke simulation stage:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case ibex --stage github_sim
```

The expected pass marker is:

```text
IBEX_SMOKE_PASS
```

The main smoke log is:

```text
build/sv-regress/ibex/artifacts/logs/github-sim.log
```

## CV32E40P Smoke Simulation

Run lint and the CV32E40P smoke simulation:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case cv32e40p --stage lint --stage github_sim
```

Run only the CV32E40P smoke simulation stage:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case cv32e40p --stage github_sim
```

The expected pass marker is:

```text
CV32E40P_SMOKE_PASS
```

The main smoke log is:

```text
build/sv-regress/cv32e40p/artifacts/logs/github-sim.log
```

## Local Verilator Lint

Docker remains the default lint runner. To use the local `verilator` binary for
lint:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case ibex --stage lint --lint-runner local
```

For both smoke cases:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run --case ibex --case cv32e40p --stage lint --lint-runner local
```

The lint log is:

```text
build/sv-regress/<case>/artifacts/logs/verilator-lint.log
```

## Helloworld Simulation Tier

The `helloworld_sim` stage is opt-in and runs real firmware in upstream-style
testbench environments:

- Ibex uses upstream `examples/simple_system`, replaces the original
  `ibex_top` with the Naja-generated `ibex_top`, builds `hello_test.vmem`, and
  expects `IBEX_HELLOWORLD_SIM_PASS`.
- The `ibex_dit_sim` and `ibex_dummy_instr_sim` stages reuse the same upstream
  simple-system environment to run the self-checking `dit_test` and
  `dummy_instr_test` programs. They generate a separate `ibex_secure_naja.v`
  with `-GSecureIbex=1`, then compile the upstream simple-system wrapper with
  matching SecureIbex memory-integrity wiring.
- The `ibex_pmp_sim` stage generates a separate `ibex_pmp_naja.v` with
  `-GPMPEnable=1`, then runs upstream `pmp_smoke_test` and checks that the
  protected store raises the expected store access fault.
- The `ibex_secure_dit_sim` and `ibex_secure_dummy_instr_sim` stages generate a
  separate `ibex_secure_naja.v` with `-GSecureIbex=1`, then compile the upstream
  simple-system wrapper with matching SecureIbex memory-integrity wiring. These
  are compatibility aliases for the secure configuration.
- CV32E40P uses upstream `example_tb/core`, replaces the original
  `cv32e40p_top` with the Naja-generated `cv32e40p_top`, builds
  `custom/hello_world.hex`, compiles the upstream Verilator testbench around
  the generated netlist, and expects `CV32E40P_HELLOWORLD_SIM_PASS`.
- The `cv32e40p_hwlp_sim` stage generates a separate `cv32e40p_pulp_naja.v`
  with `-GCOREV_PULP=1`, patches the upstream `hwlp_test` hardware-loop
  mnemonics into raw instruction words for stock RISC-V GNU toolchains, and
  expects `CV32E40P_HWLP_SIM_PASS`.
- CVA6 uses the upstream Verilator `ariane_testharness` and FESVR loader from
  the CVA6 repository, wraps the generated elaborated `cva6` netlist with a
  small `ariane` compatibility module, runs upstream `hello_world.c`, and
  expects `CVA6_HELLOWORLD_SIM_PASS`.

Case-specific stages must be launched per case:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case ibex \
  --stage lint \
  --stage github_sim \
  --stage helloworld_sim \
  --stage ibex_pmp_sim \
  --stage ibex_dit_sim \
  --stage ibex_dummy_instr_sim

python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case cv32e40p \
  --stage lint \
  --stage github_sim \
  --stage helloworld_sim \
  --stage interrupt_sim \
  --stage cv32e40p_hwlp_sim

python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case cva6_testharness \
  --stage lint \
  --stage helloworld_sim \
  --lint-runner local \
  --require-firmware-sim-tools
```

Run only helloworld simulation:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case ibex \
  --case cv32e40p \
  --stage helloworld_sim
```

Missing optional firmware simulation tools are reported as skipped. To make missing
tools fail the command:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case ibex \
  --stage helloworld_sim \
  --require-firmware-sim-tools
```

Run the extended Ibex simple-system diagnostics:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case ibex \
  --stage ibex_pmp_sim \
  --stage ibex_dit_sim \
  --stage ibex_dummy_instr_sim \
  --require-firmware-sim-tools
```

Run the CV32E40P hardware-loop diagnostic:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case cv32e40p \
  --stage cv32e40p_hwlp_sim \
  --require-firmware-sim-tools
```

The helloworld simulation log is:

```text
build/sv-regress/<case>/artifacts/logs/helloworld-sim.log
```

## CV32E40P Extended Simulation Tier

The `interrupt_sim` stage runs the CV32E40P upstream `example_tb/core`
interrupt program with the same generated `cv32e40p_top` netlist and expects
`CV32E40P_INTERRUPT_SIM_PASS` when the generated netlist handles the interrupt
sequence correctly:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case cv32e40p \
  --stage interrupt_sim \
  --require-firmware-sim-tools
```

The `cv32e40p_hwlp_sim` stage runs the upstream `hwlp_test` program against a
`COREV_PULP=1` generated netlist:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py run \
  --case cv32e40p \
  --stage cv32e40p_hwlp_sim \
  --require-firmware-sim-tools
```

The extended CV32E40P simulation logs are:

```text
build/sv-regress/cv32e40p/artifacts/logs/interrupt-sim.log
build/sv-regress/cv32e40p/artifacts/logs/cv32e40p-hwlp-sim.log
```

For local diagnosis, pass `--sim-plusarg +naja_irq_debug` to
`regress/sv/cases/cv32e40p/cv32e40p_example_tb.py` to print the interrupt mode,
pending word, visible IRQ lines, acknowledge ID, and core PC. Use
`--sim-plusarg +naja_irq_entry_debug` for a focused 96-cycle trace once Test 2
raises all IRQs. The same helper also accepts `--core-source rtl`, which builds
the upstream CV32E40P RTL from `cv32e40p_manifest.flist` into a separate
`interrupt_sim_rtl` work directory for reference comparison.

The core-v-verif UVM environment remains outside the GitHub open-tool tier
because it needs a full SystemVerilog/UVM commercial simulator stack. Its
Verilator-compatible CV32E40P core-testbench path overlaps with the upstream
CV32E40P core testbench used here, so the CI tier focuses on expanding those
firmware simulations.

## Artifacts

Per case, artifacts are written under:

```text
build/sv-regress/<case>/artifacts/
```

Useful files include:

```text
summary.json
logs/generate.log
logs/load-dump.log
logs/verilator-lint.log
logs/github-sim.log
logs/helloworld-sim.log
logs/ibex-dit-sim.log
logs/ibex-dummy-instr-sim.log
logs/interrupt-sim.log
logs/cv32e40p-hwlp-sim.log
ibex_secure.flist
ibex_secure_diagnostics.log
ibex_pmp.flist
ibex_pmp_diagnostics.log
cv32e40p_pulp.flist
cv32e40p_pulp_diagnostics.log
verilator-lint-command.json

ibex-dit-sim-command-<n>.json
ibex-dummy-instr-sim-command-<n>.json
interrupt-sim-command-<n>.json
cv32e40p-hwlp-sim-command-<n>.json
```

The legacy `verilator-command.json` is still written for compatibility and
contains the lint command.

## Clean

Remove the SV regress work directory:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/sv_regress.py clean
```

## PULP prepared EDA benchmarks

`pulp_benchmarks.py` complements the repository-checkout cases with the
[self-contained PULP release](https://github.com/pulp-platform/eda-benchmarks/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
It pins v0.1.0 and verifies the release archive's SHA-256 before extraction.
No RTL is vendored, generated, patched, or substituted. Each target uses the
release's `targets.mk` top and its variant-local `filelist.f`, including the
supplied wrappers, include directories, defines, and memory stubs.

```sh
# Small PR tier: CV32E40P, FP32 FMA, minimal Ibex, and SPI host.
# Downloads the pinned release unless --archive supplies a local copy.
python3 regress/sv/pulp_benchmarks.py --lint-runner local

# Complete, bounded survey; known failures deliberately return nonzero.
python3 regress/sv/pulp_benchmarks.py --all --timeout 90

# Individual cases and custom build/package locations are supported.
python3 regress/sv/pulp_benchmarks.py \
  --case ibex.full --timeout 120 \
  --archive /tmp/pulp-benchmarks-v0.1.0.tar.gz \
  --najaeda-path build/test/najaeda --output build/pulp-full-ibex
```

Use the Python interpreter matching the built Naja extension (Python 3.12+
for archive extraction). The runner itself needs only the standard library;
the built `najaeda` package must also have its normal runtime dependencies.
`--lint-runner docker` uses the same Verilator v5.046 image as the external SV
runner; `local` requires Verilator on PATH. Omitting the option runs load/dump
only. Each load/dump and lint subprocess has a separate wall-clock limit.
Missing lint tools fail; they do not silently skip.

The `PULP SV Regress` workflow builds Naja using the canonical Linux Release
configuration, runs the small tier and lints each complete generated netlist
with Naja's `najaeda_primitives.v` simulation models, copied into each case's
artifact directory. Both local and Docker lint use this copy; Docker mounts
the artifact directory once for both inputs. A second tier elaborates
`mempool.minpool`, `ita.default`, `cvfpu.full`, and `cva6.default`, with a 240-second limit per
case and the same strict diagnostic checks. This tier does not dump or lint
netlists; its artifacts and aggregate summary live in
`build/pulp-benchmarks/elaboration/`, preserving the complete-dump summary.
To reproduce it locally:

```sh
python3 regress/sv/pulp_benchmarks.py \
  --case mempool.minpool --case ita.default --case cvfpu.full --case cva6.default \
  --elaboration-only --timeout 240 --output build/pulp-benchmarks/elaboration
```

Manual dispatch with `survey=true`
attempts all 23 variants. It always uploads diagnostics, commands, counts, netlists, and
summaries. This is a frontend load/dump and syntax/linking regression, **not a
functional equivalence or simulation test**. No technology library is needed.

Naja uses its ordinary strict loading behavior. The upstream Yosys flow's
`--compat-mode`, `--compat=vcs`, `--allow-use-before-declare`,
`--best-effort-hierarchy`, and variant-specific `yosys-slang.args` are not
silently forwarded or emulated. In particular, unknown-module blackboxing is
disabled. Naja unsupported diagnostics fail the run. Ordinary Slang warnings,
2-state comparison warnings, and memory-inference fallbacks remain in reports;
a fallback to generic sequential lowering is not itself an unsupported error.

Artifacts default to `build/pulp-benchmarks/<design>.<variant>/` with an aggregate
`summary.json` in the parent directory. Each case has its own process, so a
crash, exception, or timeout does not prevent subsequent cases from running.
A timeout is an incomplete measurement, not proof of unsupported RTL. Stale
netlist/statistics files are removed before each case. Temporary extracted RTL
is removed afterward; the archive checksum and copied variant filelist make
source selection reproducible.

The initial [23-variant survey and CI selection](PULP_RESULTS.md) records the
local build, timing limits, diagnostics, and remaining verification limits.

### ITA upstream functional validation (experimental)

`ita_simulation.py` reuses the upstream ITA test generator and seven-phase
scoreboard at the exact revision used by the prepared release. It runs both
the prepared RTL and the Naja structural dump against the same seed-0,
64-by-64 attention/feedforward vectors, with bias and randomized stalls.
This is currently a diagnostic workflow, not a passing CI gate: local
Verilator 5.052 simulation of the original RTL already reports golden-vector
mismatches. A passing elaboration must not be interpreted as passing this test.

```sh
python3 -m venv /tmp/ita-vectors
/tmp/ita-vectors/bin/pip install numpy onnx
python3 regress/sv/ita_simulation.py \
  --archive /tmp/pulp-benchmarks-v0.1.0.tar.gz \
  --generator-python /tmp/ita-vectors/bin/python \
  --najaeda-path build/test/najaeda
```

Use the interpreter matching the compiled Naja extension for the runner.
Verilator with `--binary --timing` support and a C++ toolchain must be on PATH.
`--no-stalls`, `--seed`, `--jobs`, `--timeout` (per subprocess), and
`--verilator-opt` support diagnosis. By default,
`--hierarchical` with Verilator's default optimizations compiles the large generated controller,
dot-product, requantizer, and softmax modules as separate blocks; this avoids
flattening their full combined simulation model during Verilation.
The local optimized flat build hit an internal Verilator fault, and a flat
`-O0` build exceeded 300 seconds. `--no-hierarchical` allows reproducing these
compiler issues. Failures and timeouts return nonzero.
Hierarchical builds use one build job to avoid a Verilator 5.052 recursive
makefile regeneration race; `--jobs` controls the original-RTL build.
Flat and hierarchical generated models use separate build directories.

All downloaded sources are commit-pinned and SHA-256 checked. The original
simulation replaces the synthesis SRAM stub with the matching upstream
behavioral SRAM. The generated simulation attaches that same model to its
otherwise empty SRAM leaf, checking the pinned variant's exact port shape;
the raw dump is preserved. This validates the surrounding logic with an
external memory model, not Naja lowering of SRAM behavior.

The testbench adapter reads packed-array `$fscanf` targets through scalar
temporaries to avoid invalid Verilator-generated C++, checks scan success,
and requires all eight groups of 256 output transactions (phase 3 has two
groups). Like upstream, it continues checking after a golden mismatch;
the runner rejects any log containing a mismatch. It also records all 2,048
output transactions and compares their phase, value, and time between RTL
and netlist. That comparison is reported separately and cannot override a
failed golden check. It does not replace expected outputs with RTL results.
Simulation warnings are retained in logs rather than made
fatal; this runner is separate from strict netlist lint.

Artifacts, commands, timings, and stage outcomes are written under
`build/ita-simulation/`, including `summary.json`, `original-run.log`, and
`generated-build.log`. Both simulations must pass for overall success.

### PULP job report

The PULP workflow publishes a GitHub Actions job summary and includes `report.md`
in its `pulp-sv-regress` artifact, even when a regression fails. Each selected
case reports its result, load/statistics/dump/lint timings, and total worker plus
lint time. Unselected release variants and unavailable results are explicit.
The larger-design elaboration tier also runs after a smoke-tier failure.

The benchmark worker uses the najaeda `count_child_instances()`, `count_terms()`,
`count_bit_terms()`, `count_nets()`, and `count_bit_nets()` APIs on the elaborated
top. Counts describe the top model, not flattened hierarchy or mapped cell area.
Statistics are saved before dumping, so a later dump failure can retain them.

Regenerate the report from existing JSON without loading najaeda:

```bash
python3 regress/sv/pulp_report.py --root build/pulp-benchmarks
```

An optional `--functional build/ita-simulation/summary.json` includes the
experimental ITA upstream scoreboard and RTL/netlist trace comparison as
separate results. The workflow does not run that experimental simulation by
default. Setting `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` appends the report to the GitHub job page.
