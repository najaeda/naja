# PULP EDA benchmark frontend survey

## C910 sequential lowering follow-up (2026-10-04)

The working-tree fix on top of `3989a4b1` addresses actual lowering errors
behind the mixed-assignment diagnostics. Whole-vector replay was emitting
flops for bits that the process never wrote, and nested reset writes could
emit duplicate drivers. The MMU's `lsu_data_flop[58:0]` consequently also drove
bits `[63:59]`, which belong to a separate RTL process. AXI `id_queue` element
and field resets similarly overlapped. The frontend now masks emitted storage
to the process's assigned bits and merges nested targets before replay.
The mask also applies to direct and blocking-scheduling replay, with loop
selections resolved in their iteration context.

Simulation exposed a second issue in conditional multi-assignment lowering:
mixed zero/one asynchronous resets were implemented as data muxes. These now
use separate reset/set cells, preserving asynchronous behavior, reset polarity,
and clock edge. The focused regression checks one driver per output bit and
compares dumped Verilog with the original RTL for both clock edges and reset
polarities, including nested partial writes, procedural loops, blocking replay,
reset assertions between clock edges, and X-valued data.

The final local run loads/dumps C910 in 16.51 seconds and completes Verilator
5.052 lint in 142.62 seconds. The previous **five `BLKANDNBLK` errors and six
`MULTIDRIVEN` warnings are gone**. Four `UNOPTFLAT` warnings remain around AXI response/ready paths through the
zero-memory adapter, demux, and burst unwrap. No lint suppression was added;
C910 remains outside the passing strict-lint tier.

A separate diagnostic lint of the unmodified source RTL also reports
`UNOPTFLAT` through the zero-memory response, burst-unwrap `b_cnt_err`, and
AXI arbitration path. It reports one cycle warning rather than the generated
netlist's four; this establishes a source-side warning in the same region,
not bit-level equivalence of all reported cycles. That diagnostic run uses
`-Wno-fatal` to collect upstream warnings and is **not** a strict-lint pass.
Its log is under `build/pulp-c910-original-lint/`.

Further diagnostic runs distinguish packed dependency tracking from a change
in logic. Adding `/* verilator split_var */` to internal packed wires alone
leaves all four `UNOPTFLAT` warnings. Adding the annotation to packed child
module ports as well eliminates them. Public top-level ports are excluded:
Verilator cannot split them and otherwise emits five `SPLITVAR` warnings.
The annotated copy completes strict lint with return code 0 in 116.86 seconds,
using the original runner flags and no additional warning suppression. This
provides evidence that packed-port dependency tracking contributes to these
reports; it is not a functional equivalence proof. The annotations are confined
to diagnostic artifacts, so the ordinary dump still reports four warnings.
Commands and the successful result are recorded under
`build/pulp-c910-split-ports-diagnostic/strict-summary.json`.

Validation passes all 1,165 frontend tests, all four existing PULP smoke designs,
and the Sphinx HTML build. Final C910 artifacts are under
`build/pulp-c910-sequential-verified/`; smoke artifacts are under
`build/pulp-c910-fix-smoke/`.

## C910 division/remainder follow-up (2026-10-04)

The working-tree fix on top of `5fb0566a` corrects two independent issues:
the PULP runner now lints with the dumper-generated `naja_primitives.v`, and
the dumper preserves division/remainder model defaults even when no instance
parameter overrides exist. Both C910 instances retain `.WIDTH(40)` and
unsigned operation. The shared parameter emitter omits `.SIGNED(0)` because
it matches the generated module's default. The generated model also uses separate signed
and unsigned branches: the previous conditional expression incorrectly
performed unsigned arithmetic for cases such as signed 4-bit `1 / -1`.

The rebuilt Release frontend loads and dumps C910 in 25.06 seconds. Verilator
5.052 now completes lint in 128.42 seconds with **no missing-module or width
errors**, but reports five `BLKANDNBLK` errors, six `MULTIDRIVEN` warnings, and
four `UNOPTFLAT` warnings. These involve the MMU data flop, AXI linked-data
queues, separately clocked datapath bits, and combinational paths; their causes
are not established by this run. No suppression of those diagnostics was added, and C910
remains outside the passing lint tier. The follow-up used a 240-second limit
and records its commands, generated models, netlist, and diagnostics under
`build/pulp-c910-fixed/`.

Focused simulation compares source RTL with the dumped design at widths 1,
4, and 40, signed and unsigned, for both combinational and clocked quotient
and remainder outputs. It covers 1,572 input vectors, including division by
zero, negative operands, signed overflow, and X/Z inputs. The original model
fails the signed comparison; the corrected model passes. Lint timeouts now
terminate the full process group, including Verilator launcher children.

The four existing smoke designs (CV32E40P, FP32 FMA, minimal Ibex, SPI host)
all pass load/dump/lint with the generated models. The generated latch model
carries the same narrowly scoped intentional-latch annotation as the previous
handwritten model. Validation also passes 76 dumper tests, 1,164 frontend
tests, 12 PULP runner/report tests, five ITA adapter tests, and the Sphinx HTML
build. The smoke artifacts are under `build/pulp-generated-model-smoke/`.

## Current full survey (2026-10-04)

Reconfigured and rebuilt the existing macOS arm64 **Release** build from
Naja `5fb0566a` (0.7.27), using Python 3.14.7, Verilator 5.052, and the same
SHA-256-verified v0.1.0 archive as the original survey. The working-tree changes
at measurement time only affect CI/reporting/documentation, not the frontend.
All 23 variants were attempted without RTL edits, compatibility relaxations,
or unknown-module blackboxing. Each load/dump and each lint has a separate
120-second wall-clock limit. These are local results, not Ubuntu CI timings.

**Frontend outcome: 12/23 elaborate successfully; 11/23 also finish dumping.**
The remaining 11 fail with diagnostics: four Slang compilation failures
(Ara, Cheshire, NVDLA, RedMule) and seven Naja lowering failures (O-POPE,
Serial Link, four Snitch variants, Spatz). Terapool elaborates successfully
but does not finish dumping within the combined load/dump limit.

The initial end-to-end sweep records four strict lint passes, one lint
failure (C910), six lint timeouts, eleven load failures, and one load/dump
timeout. The local Verilator Perl launcher left child processes running after
some timeouts. Those children were stopped; all six timed-out lint cases were
subsequently rechecked with process-group cleanup. The original JSON records
are retained rather than overwritten. Timings from the initial sweep are not
isolated performance measurements.

After clean lint follow-ups, **four variants pass the complete load/dump/lint
path**, two have confirmed lint failures (full Ibex and C910), and five still
exceed the 120-second lint limit (CVA6, full CVFPU, ITA, MinPool, MemPool).
Together with eleven load failures and Terapool's dump timeout, these account
for all 23 variants. The five clean lint timeouts used new process groups and
killed the entire group on timeout, preventing the earlier orphan overlap.

| Variant | Load/dump result | Load/dump wall time (s) | Observation |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `ara.default` | failed | 0.84 | Slang: implicit enum conversions in `lane_sequencer.sv`. |
| `cheshire.default` | failed | 0.78 | Slang: enum conversion and `dtmcs_q` used before declaration. |
| `cv32e40p.default` | pass | 1.31 | Strict lint passes. |
| `cva6.default` | pass | 37.95 | Loads and dumps; flat lint exceeds 120 seconds in both the initial survey and clean follow-up. |
| `cvfpu.fp32_fma` | pass | 0.41 | Strict lint passes. |
| `cvfpu.full` | pass | 12.67 | Loads and dumps; flat lint exceeds 120 seconds in both the initial survey and clean follow-up. |
| `ibex.minimal` | pass | 0.84 | Strict lint passes. |
| `ibex.full` | pass | 2.78 | Loads and dumps; follow-up lint fails two shadow-ALU `UNOPTFLAT` warnings. |
| `ita.default` | pass | 50.25 | Loads and dumps; flat lint exceeds 120 seconds in both the initial survey and clean follow-up. |
| `mempool.minpool` | pass | 65.13 | Loads and dumps; flat lint exceeds 120 seconds in both the initial survey and clean follow-up. |
| `mempool.mempool` | pass | 119.27 | Loads and dumps; flat lint exceeds 120 seconds in both the initial survey and clean follow-up. |
| `mempool.terapool` | timeout | 120.64 | Elaboration passes; dump exceeds the 120-second combined budget. |
| `nvdla.top` | failed | 0.73 | Slang: inconsistent/missing timescales. |
| `opope.default` | failed | 6.88 | Naja: continuous-assignment LHS in `hci_core_fifo.sv:278`. |
| `pulp_c910.default` | pass | 32.62 | Loads and dumps; lint cannot find simulation primitive `naja_divmod`. |
| `redmule.default` | failed | 0.46 | Slang: implicit conversions to `fp_format_e`. |
| `serial_link.default` | failed | 0.78 | Naja: register/interface aggregate types (`reg2hw`, `hw2reg`). |
| `snitch_cluster.minimal` | failed | 46.46 | Naja: conditional RHS in `axi_burst_splitter_gran`; peripheral register aggregates/sequential lowering. |
| `snitch_cluster.default` | failed | 59.46 | Naja: conditional RHS in `axi_burst_splitter_gran`; peripheral register aggregates/sequential lowering. |
| `snitch_cluster.default_latch` | failed | 54.58 | Naja: conditional RHS in `axi_burst_splitter_gran`; peripheral register aggregates/sequential lowering. |
| `snitch_cluster.occamy` | failed | 57.44 | Naja: conditional RHS in `axi_burst_splitter_gran`; peripheral register aggregates/sequential lowering. |
| `spatz.default` | failed | 86.91 | Naja: function-call RHS in `spatz_vfu.sv:1522`. |
| `spi_host.default` | pass | 0.30 | Strict lint passes. |

Terapool's separate 240-second elaboration-only follow-up passes in 64.39 s
(including startup/cleanup; load itself is 53.93 s). Full Ibex's separate lint
follow-up fails in 33.71 s with the two known `UNOPTFLAT` warnings; its limit
was 240 seconds. Thus its initial `lint_timeout` does not replace the confirmed
lint diagnostic.

Notable changes from the October 1 baseline:

- C910's parser errors no longer reproduce. It loads and dumps, but the lint
  harness lacks the `naja_divmod` simulation module referenced by the dump.
- All three MemPool variants elaborate; MinPool and MemPool also dump.
- CVA6, full CVFPU, and ITA load and dump.
- All four Snitch variants now finish and report explicit lowering failures.
  They are no longer merely inconclusive timeouts.
- Spatz's compound-shift issue is gone; the function-call RHS remains unsupported.

Raw results, build provenance, logs, generated netlists, and the rendered
report are under `build/pulp-current-survey/`. `verified-summary.json` and
`verified-report.md` combine the initial sweep with the completed lint
follow-ups. Lint follow-ups have separate
`lint-followup.json` and `lint-followup.log` files in each case directory.
Terapool's elaboration follow-up is under `build/pulp-current-elaboration/`.
No functional simulation was rerun as part of this survey; earlier ITA
functional results below remain separate evidence.

  --archive /tmp/pulp-benchmarks-v0.1.0.tar.gz \

  --output build/pulp-current-elaboration --timeout 240
```

## Original baseline (2026-10-01)

Measured on 2026-10-01 with Naja `927b9ca2` (0.7.27), rebuilt from source
using the existing macOS arm64 **Debug** CMake build and Python 3.14. The input is the
[prepared v0.1.0 release](https://github.com/pulp-platform/eda-benchmarks/releases/tag/v0.1.0),
SHA-256 `a27eaca9359cd2c0b646892325355e102ae563bd8f772c77f18697ff8c4ad603`.
This checksum also matches GitHub's published asset digest.

Every variant uses its supplied top, filelist, macros, wrappers, and source
stubs. No RTL fixes, best-effort hierarchy, or unknown-module blackboxing were
used. The initial survey applied a 90-second wall-clock limit per load/dump.
Timings are local observations, not Linux Release CI performance guarantees; some
follow-up tests ran concurrently with the survey.

## Recommended PR tier

| Target | Input sources | Load/dump | Complete-dump lint |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `cv32e40p.default` | 28 | ~7–9 s | ~4 s, pass |
| `cvfpu.fp32_fma` | 8 | ~1.5 s | ~1 s, pass |
| `ibex.minimal` | 45 | ~4–5 s | ~2 s, pass |
| `spi_host.default` | 25 | ~1 s | <1 s, pass |

These are the runner's default cases and the new `PULP SV Regress` workflow's
PR/push selection. FP32 FMA and SPI host add coverage beyond the existing
Ibex/CV32E40P external regressions. Those CPU cases also exercise this release's
specific source pins, configuration, and wrappers.

Local lint used Verilator 5.052 and the complete Naja dump plus
`najaeda_primitives.v`, with only `ASCRANGE` suppressed, matching the existing
external-regression convention. CI uses the existing pinned Verilator 5.046
Docker image. The Docker daemon was unavailable locally, so that image and the
Ubuntu GitHub job have not been executed here. No simulation or equivalence
check was performed; successful load/dump/lint does not prove functional
correctness.

`ibex.full` also loads and dumps in ~20–22 seconds but fails strict lint with
two `UNOPTFLAT` warnings involving the secure/lockstep shadow core's ALU. It is
available as an explicit case, but not promoted to the green tier. These
warnings need investigation before either suppression or promotion.

## Complete initial survey

All 23 variants were attempted: **5 load/dump passes, 7 failures, 11 timeouts**.

| `snitch_cluster.default` | timeout | 90.04 | No unsupported error emitted before timeout; inconclusive. |
| `snitch_cluster.default_latch` | timeout | 90.04 | Before timeout: unsupported latch pattern, `snitch_regfile_latch.sv:76`. |
| `snitch_cluster.occamy` | timeout | 90.05 | No unsupported error emitted before timeout; inconclusive. |
| `spatz.default` | timeout | 90.06 | Before timeout: unsupported compound shift assignment, `spatz_controller.sv:123`. |
| `spi_host.default` | pass | 0.97 | Also passes complete-dump lint; PR tier. |

The initial local logs and summary are under `build/pulp-survey/`; the final
strict smoke/lint artifacts are under `build/pulp-benchmarks/`. Full-Ibex lint
artifacts are under `build/pulp-additional-passing/ibex.full/`. These generated
files are intentionally untracked.

Useful follow-up work is streaming assignment LHS lowering (ITA), latch
statement patterns (MemPool/Snitch), compound shifts (Spatz), and aggregate/LHS
lowering (Serial Link/O-POPE). Re-run the inconclusive cases in a Release build
with a larger budget before deciding whether they belong in a scheduled tier.

## Follow-up: compound shifts and streaming LHS

The working-tree frontend changes add combinational compound shifts and
fixed-size streaming assignment LHS lowering. They preserve signed right
shifts, full-width shift counts, blocking-assignment replay, nested streams,
non-divisible slice widths, fixed arrays, multiple targets, and MSB-aligned
consumption of wider streaming sources. Dynamic/with-clause/overlapping targets
and sequential streaming assignments remain explicitly rejected.

The generated `compound_shifts` benchmark passes 262,144 vectors, including a
70-bit shift count. Original RTL passes the same vectors. The generated
`streaming_lhs` benchmark passes 1,048,576 vectors. Verilator 5.052 disagrees on
partial streaming-target slices and swapping target variables when simulating
the original streaming RTL. A separate C++ constructor test forces Slang
constant evaluation through localparams and confirms the independent expected
partial-slice, nested-stream, wider-source, and swap values. The streaming CI
simulation therefore checks the Naja dump against these golden values, not
Verilator's streaming RTL behavior.

Re-running the unmodified release with a 180-second limit:

- **ITA:** the streaming-LHS diagnostic is gone. Loading finishes with only
  unsupported latch patterns in `ita_register_file_1w_multi_port_read.sv:161`
  (two elaborations) and `ita_register_file_1w_multi_port_read_we.sv:171`.
- **Spatz:** the compound-shift diagnostic is gone; the full cluster still
  times out after 180 seconds in the local Debug build. This is not a full
  Spatz pass.

## Follow-up: independent always_latch writes

The latch lowering now handles independent guarded writes in statement lists
and statically bounded nested loops. It preserves per-bit retention while an
enable is low, source-order priority for repeated writes, static array and
part-select targets, and both blocking and nonblocking scheduling when used
consistently. Dynamic targets, same-block read-after-write dependencies,
function calls, timed assignments, and mixed scheduling are rejected.

The focused `latch_loops` fixture passes 16,385 state transitions in both the
original RTL and the generated Naja netlist. The complete frontend suite passes
1,140 tests. The ITA register-file modules, MemPool register file, and Snitch
register file now each load, dump, and pass Verilator lint, so these cases do
not require a new NLDB0 primitive.

The MemPool full design now elaborates successfully with zero Naja unsupported
diagnostics. The `axi_dw_downsizer.sv` `resp_precedence` function-call RHS
cases and the `ctrl_registers.sv` loop-step lowering are handled by the
frontend. Structural dumping of the full MemPool netlist exceeded 300 seconds
locally, so CI runs this design as an elaboration-only frontend regression;
full dumping remains a separate performance investigation.

The exhaustive case path accepts a no-`default` function case only when all
values of a small fixed-width domain are covered by constant labels. Other
incomplete cases remain unsupported. This keeps the lowering conservative while
supporting the AXI response precedence function.

Logs are under `build/pulp-lowering-fixes/`. The initial survey table above is
retained as the baseline; neither design has been promoted to the passing CI
tier.

## Follow-up: expanded elaboration tier (2026-10-03)

Rebuilt Naja `20d67a27` in the existing macOS arm64 Release build, using
Python 3.14 and the same checksum-verified v0.1.0 archive. The workflow now
adds `ita.default`, `cvfpu.full`, and `cva6.default` alongside `mempool.minpool` in the strict
elaboration-only tier, with a 240-second limit per case:

| Target | Elaboration outcome | Wall-clock seconds |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `mempool.minpool` | pass | 24.66 |
| `ita.default` | pass | 52.00 |
| `cvfpu.full` | pass | 11.03 |
| `cva6.default` | pass | 27.98 |

Each passing case has a successful diagnostics summary, no error/fatal or
Naja unsupported diagnostics, the expected top, and a nonempty top interface.
These measurements include process startup and cleanup; other local work was
running, so they are not isolated performance measurements. This tier does
not establish structural dump, lint, simulation, or equivalence success.

`snitch_cluster.minimal` completes in Release but fails strict elaboration
after about 50 seconds on register aggregate types and sequential lowering
in `snitch_cluster_peripheral`. `spatz.default` fails after about 75 seconds
on an unresolved function-call RHS in `spatz_vfu.sv:1522` (`always_comb`).
O-POPE and Serial Link also remain failures
when rechecked with the refreshed Debug build. They are not promoted.

Release reports are under `build/pulp-expansion-release/`; the additional
failure reports are under `build/pulp-expansion-extra/`. CI writes the
elaboration tier into `build/pulp-benchmarks/elaboration/`, so its aggregate
summary no longer overwrites the complete-dump tier's summary.

## ITA upstream functional validation (2026-10-03)

The experimental `ita_simulation.py` runner reuses upstream ITA revision
`ba96519becce195d64e85eb9a5302e8a1d5487e7`, matching the benchmark release,
and its golden-vector generator and seven-phase testbench. Local validation
used Verilator 5.052, Naja `20d67a27` Release, Python 3.14, NumPy 2.5.3, and
ONNX 1.23.1. Vectors use seed 0, dimensions S/E/P/F=64, one head, bias,
identity activation, and randomized stalls (Verilator seed 1).

The original RTL and Naja netlist each completed all **2,048 output
transactions**, with **identical phase, output data, and timestamps**. This
is finite simulation evidence of preserved behavior, not formal equivalence.
Both also reported the **same six mismatches against upstream golden values**.
The first occurs in phase 3 at 4622.6 ns: actual
`80131f1db08af3ec80807f753c7f80dd`, expected
`80131f1db08af3ec80807f753c7f80ef`. The cause of this shared baseline mismatch
was not established in that initial run (see the follow-up below); the runner returns failure even when RTL and
netlist traces agree. It is not promoted to a green CI gate.

The synthesis SRAM stub is replaced by the upstream behavioral model on the
RTL side; the same model is attached to the generated netlist's explicit
SRAM blackbox. Its shape is checked (256 words, 416 bits, two ports, one-cycle
latency). The initial zero-delay run otherwise left the generated logic unchanged. The testbench adapter
works around Verilator's packed-array `$fscanf` C++ generation issue using
scalar temporaries and checks successful reads. Golden comparisons remain
intact, with complete transaction counts required.

Flat optimized Verilation hit an internal compiler fault; flat `-O0`
exceeded a 300-second limit. Hierarchical Verilation of the four large
datapaths succeeded, and the generated simulation completed in about
2.6 seconds. This is now the runner's default compile strategy.

Reports and logs are under `build/ita-simulation/`, including
`functional-comparison.json`, `original-complete-run.log`, and
`generated-complete-run.log`. See the README for the repeatable command.

## Reproduction and interpretation

See [README.md](README.md#pulp-prepared-eda-benchmarks) for the commands and
workflow dispatch options. A complete survey intentionally returns nonzero
when any variant fails or times out. There are no expected-failure masks.

A timeout alone is inconclusive. Some designs emit explicit unsupported
construct diagnostics before their timeout; those observations are useful
frontend work items even though the entire load did not finish. Strict Slang
compilation errors are separate from Naja lowering failures: upstream's Yosys
flow enables permissive compatibility options that this runner does not apply.

The local code knowledge graph was refreshed incrementally for code. Its full
semantic refresh needs an unavailable LLM API key; the code refresh also
reported existing duplicate-node collisions in `SNLDesignModeling`.


## ITA zero-delay mismatch diagnosis (2026-10-03)

The six golden mismatches originate at the latch-based weight buffer read
boundary in Verilator 5.052. Instrumenting the original RTL found eight
64-output blocks whose final captured weight vector differed from the other
63 vectors: transactions 831, 959, 1087, 1535, 1599, 1727, 1855 and 1919.
Only the first 128-bit write chunk was overwritten; six corruptions survived
requantization/saturation as visible output mismatches in processing lane 0.
The expected values in the scoreboard match the on-disk golden vectors.

The reduced `ita_latch_repro.sv` isolates the scheduling difference without
Naja or the ITA testbench. At the same edge as a bank overwrite, Icarus reads
the bank's old `0x11`, while Verilator reads the shared write register's
transient `0x22`; the final bank contents are `0x33` in both. The full upstream
buffer also reproduces this in Verilator with `-O0`. Verilator documents that
its conversion of nonblocking assignments in combinational logic can cause
simulation races: <https://verilator.org/guide/latest/warnings.html#combdly>.

The runner now models 1 ps read propagation on that buffer in both RTL and
generated simulation. This preserves the complete buffer logic and golden
vectors, while separating the memory output update from the reader's clock
edge. The JSON and Markdown reports disclose the delay; setting
`--weight-read-delay-ps 0` retains the failing control. The original structural
dump is not edited. A delay on the cascaded clock gates was tested and rejected
because it changes enable sampling; the implemented model delays only read data.


Validation with the 1 ps model completed successfully on the same local
Verilator 5.052 / Naja `20d67a27` Release environment:

| Stage | Result | Seconds |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Vector generation | pass | 0.958 |
| Naja load + dump | pass | 45.524 |
| Original RTL build | pass | 8.398 |
| Original golden scoreboard | pass | 0.188 |
| Generated netlist build | pass | 317.899 |
| Generated golden scoreboard | pass | 2.697 |
| RTL/netlist trace comparison | pass, 2,048 transactions | — |

Reusing these binaries, all six combinations of vector seeds 0/1/2 and
Verilator stall seeds 1/7 also passed both golden scoreboards and exact
phase/data/timestamp comparison: **12,288 compared transactions**. Seed-0
vectors were restored afterward. Reports are in
`build/ita-simulation-timed/summary.json` and `seed-matrix.json`; the combined
PULP/ITA Markdown preview is `build/pulp-report-check/report.md`.
This establishes finite functional coverage under the disclosed read-delay
and external SRAM models. The full ITA simulation remains an explicit local
command; CI now includes its adapter unit tests but does not run the full
functional simulation by default.


## Naja primitive follow-up (2026-10-03)

The reproducer is now split into synthesizable `ita_latch_dut.sv` and a
simulation-only `ita_latch_repro.sv` driver. `ita_primitive_check.py` elaborates
only the DUT, with no unsupported diagnostics, and dumps 27 immediate
instances including five `naja_dlatch` instances and two `naja_dff` instances.
The read propagation delay is on the testbench feedback connection, outside
elaboration. No timing construct is silently discarded during lowering.

| Simulator | Read delay | Source RTL | Naja primitives | Nonblocking latch candidate |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Icarus | 0 ps | pass (`0x11`) | pass (`0x11`) | pass (`0x11`) |
| Icarus | 1 ps | pass (`0x11`) | pass (`0x11`) | pass (`0x11`) |
| Verilator 5.052 | 0 ps | fail (`0x22`) | fail (`0x22`) | fail (`0x22`) |
| Verilator 5.052 | 1 ps | pass (`0x11`) | pass (`0x11`) | pass (`0x11`) |

The observed value is the reader flop's captured data; the memory's settled
contents are `0x33` in every case. The temporary candidate changes only
`if (E) Q = D` to `if (E) Q <= D` in an artifact copy of `naja_dlatch`.
Verilator emits `COMBDLY` for this assignment and the zero-delay failure
persists. No elaboration mismatch was observed, and switching the primitive
to nonblocking assignment does not resolve this case. The generic primitive
and Naja frontend remain unchanged; the disclosed ITA read-delay model stays
in the simulation harness.

The maintained runner reproduced all 12 outcomes in
`build/ita-primitive-check-repeat/summary.json`, with per-configuration logs.
Its comparison outcome is `matched`; golden failures remain explicitly marked
`failed` rather than being relabeled as passing functional tests.
